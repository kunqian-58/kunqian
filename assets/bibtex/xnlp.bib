    abstract = { We present XNLP: an interactive browser-based system embodying a living survey of recent state-of-the-art research in the field of Explainable AI (XAI) within the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system visually organizes and illustrates XAI-NLP publications and distills their content to allow users to gain insights, generate ideas, and explore the field. We hope that XNLP can become a leading demonstrative example of a living survey, balancing the depth and quality of a traditional well-constructed survey paper with the collaborative dynamism of a widely available interactive tool. XNLP can be accessed at: https://xainlp2020.github.io/xainlp.},
